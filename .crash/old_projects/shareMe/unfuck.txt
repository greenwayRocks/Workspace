-> Objective: To create a valuable and meaningful life.

-> Ordinary things are ordinary because they are the MOST IMPORTANT!

-> Doing the ORDINARY extremely WeLL for a long time.

--------------------

Bravery -> Feeling fear but deciding that something else's more important

-> Indifference does not solve any of life problems. ( A form of avoidance)

-> Everybody's gonna feel bad sometimes and a huge component of living a healthy life is being good at accepting that.
   It's okay to feel bad. We're all gonna feel bad sometimes.

Things can spiral out of control. The whole problem is that "judgement" that
-> Negative emotions are just not acceptable.
If you feel anxious, you say "FUCK IT"!

Being anxious is part of LIFE. Like it's normal to be ANXIOUS! You're probably anxious for a good reason!
If you're angry, you might be angry for a good reason.
Negative emotions are not essentially negative. A lot of times they are helpful.

Okay the key is learning how to care about something deeper than the emotion itself.
Not beating yourself up!

Disappointment Panda ))
	The truth telling super hero that nobody WANTS around but everyone really NEEDS.
	Super hero that tells people uncomfortable truth about themselves.
	It Would just ruin the party.
        But it's the stuff we need to hear 
	-> because honestly the most important things that we ever hear in our life are often extremely painful to hear.
	
	So DP would be the superhero that walks around, knocking on doors and telling people like
		-> Hey making more money is not gonna make your kids love you
And that why you have all the humor, you have all the fucks, you have all the silly language and the superheroes and everything	


-> It's really uncomfortable to like learn that thing about yourself that, kind of, sets you free.

-> Don't hope for a life without problems. There's no such thing.
	Instead hope for a life full of good problems.

Insights about problems
-----------------------
-> To try and get rid of problems is not really the goal 
	(NOT POSSIBLE,
	so much happiness or satisfaction or fulfillment comes from the solving of problems.
So to eliminate that you are actually doing yourself a disservice.

Problems are really the building block of happiness, and that is really counterintuitive to most people.
( not easily understood in an instinctive, unconscious way )
Is happiness really no problems?
The truth is that we need some sort of struggle in our life.

The key to living a good life isn't getting rid of struggle, it's finding good struggles.

?? What if my struggles right now are really sucky?
You know what if they're really difficult and I don't really see how they can produce meaning or contribution!
-> Ultimately you need to find a way to solve them.
You're never gonna get away from the problems.
And so really what it's about is choosing your problems.

If there's a problem and you feel stuck in some way ....
When we feel stuck it's because we're in a situation to believe that
we don't have the power to solve whatever is going on in their life.
