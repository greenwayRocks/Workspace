Great for family gatherings! I did a road trip across America with my five boys &amp; Talulah in the 7 seat Model S several years ago.. @flcnhvy @Teslarati Absolutely. @justpaulinelol @Teslarati New Roadster and X will come later. @ZainRaz4 @Teslarati No, original 5 forward facing seats plus 2 rear-facing smaller seats. The new rear seats will accommodate larger passengers than before.. @Teslarati It’s a start. We expect these track times to be beaten by the actual production 7 seat Model S Plaid variant that goes into production around Oct/Nov next year.. @BocachicaMaria1 Thanks, I will stop by on the 20th!. @bonnienorman @Model3Owners They’re available through the app, but we need to make them easier to find.

We’ve only one car factory in California &amp; one Gigafactory (for batteries &amp; drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries &amp; drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs &amp; improve logistics worldwide.. @teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners Should note that these product mix &amp; logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK &amp; Ireland right now, but we don’t raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win.. @teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners That’s not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous &amp; possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I’m looking into it. @teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes &amp; logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances.. @Kristennetten @Model3Owners The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world.. @flcnhvy @hoofhrtd1254 @Teslatunity @Model3Owners Agreed. @hoofhrtd1254 @Teslatunity @Model3Owners Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval.. @Teslatunity @Model3Owners There aren’t really meant to be “Tesla incentives”, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all.. @Model3Owners Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining.. @justpaulinelol @31WA Hopefully, next year. @slashdot Personally, I think the universe looks great for 12 billion years, let alone 13.8. @wonderofscience Sagan was awesome. @Wikipedia They used to have butt bellows for blowing smoke up your … along the Thames River in London https://t.co/P8SJGokLY8. @31WA Haha exactly!. @Kristennetten Yes. @GaryTheBot_ Yes, that’s exactly what I meant, Gary the Bot!.

Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate.. @Erdayastronaut @IvanEscobosa @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Precisely. @Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven’t moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, you’ll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox &amp; fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, you’re prob ok.. @Erdayastronaut @vicvic21266 @flcnhvy @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric ????. @flcnhvy @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric You know destination weather before departure &amp; there’s no weather in space. @flcnhvy @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Everything happens so fast.

Vac engines would be dual bell &amp; fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull.. @Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Raptor turbines can spin up extremely fast.
