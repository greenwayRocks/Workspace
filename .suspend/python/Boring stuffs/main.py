# Let's find out about my life

''' I am in the process of making better version of myself. '''

'''
I can better myself in these ways:
----------------------------------
1. Never Hate (Agree that people have their own versions that are far gone from an acceptable one)
2. Don't worry (Just TROUBLE for nothing) # The Less you worry About CONSEQUENCES, you have better chances and CONFIDENCE
3. Live simply # 
4. Expect a little 
5. Give a lot
6. Always smile
7. Live with love

'''

# Self Trust and Confidence??
'''
>> I now challenge myself to my COMMITMENTS!
>> I am always growing and deep inside I have grown a lot than the others, idc but I see a lot these days!
>> I can ASSERT that I trust myself.
    '''
# Friendship Qualities??
'''
>> I live outside this world when I'm high (or am I too far gone?) I have been better at myself!
'''
# Communication Skills??
'''
>> By default, really GOOD and really courageous and energetic
>> When I'm high, I am the same person in a really GOOD STATE of MIND.
>> I even have that MODE, to unravel anything and cool off!
