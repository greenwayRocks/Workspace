Your brain is an amazing combination of hardware and software.
You're reading this right now even though the words are a mess, but your brain can make sense of it because the first and last letters of each word have stayed the same.
Your brain doesn't actually read each letter of each word but reads whole words.
The scrambled words definitely slow you down, but you're not really even trying to unscramble the letters, are you?
It just happens!
