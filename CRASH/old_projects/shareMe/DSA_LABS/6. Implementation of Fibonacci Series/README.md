[*] Fibonacci Series Implementation in C++

The series is generated by summing any two numbers starting from 0 to determine the next one.
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ……..

This problem can be solved using recursion.

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.

[*] Output of above program

Enter the number of terms of series : 20
