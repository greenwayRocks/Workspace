On the first day of Christmas,
My true love gave to me,
A partridge in a pear tree.

On the second day of Christmas,
My true love gave to me,
Two turtle doves,
And a partridge in a pear tree.

On the third day of Christmas,
My true love gave to me,
Three French hens,
Two turtle doves,
And a partridge in a pear tree.

On the fourth day of Christmas,
My true love gave to me,
Four calling birds,
Three French hens,
Two turtle doves,
And a partridge in a pear tree.

On the fifth day of Christmas,
My true love gave to me,
Five gold rings,
Four calling birds,
Three French hens,
Two turtle doves,
And a partridge in a pear tree.
