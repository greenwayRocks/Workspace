Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitatin' then no longer,
"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was nappin', and so gently y'all came rappin',
And so faintly y'all came tappin', tappin' at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard y'all" - here I opened wide the door: -
Darkness there and nothin' more.
