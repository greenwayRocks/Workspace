I never saw that y'all did paintin' need,
And therefore to your fair no paintin' set;
I found, or thought I found, y'all did exceed
That barren tender of a poet's debt:
And therefore have I slept in your report,
That y'all yourself, bein' extant, well might show
How far a modern quill doth come too short,
Speakin' of worth, what worth in y'all doth grow.
This silence for my sin y'all did impute,
Which shall be most my glory bein' dumb;
For I impair not beauty bein' mute,
When others would give life, and bring a tomb.
  There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
  Than both your poets can in praise devise.
