Selected Haiku by Issa

Don't worry, spiders,
I keep house
casually.

New Year's Day-
everything is in blossom!
I feel about average.

The snow is melting
and the village is flooded
with children.

Goes out,
comes back-
the love life of a cat.

Mosquito at my ear-
does he think
I'm deaf?

Under the evening moon
the snail
is stripped to the waist.

Even with insects-
some can sing,
some can't.

All the time I pray to Buddha
I keep on
killing mosquitoes.

Napped half the day;
no one
punished me!
