In a beautiful KDE environment, I'm getting started with **_React_**.
I'm gonna write `WIKIs` too!

## REACT `only for now`

Why bother React when there's vanilla javascript., its templates and innerHTML?
The answer is,
not rendering the first HTML View,
it's about what we need to do to update any existing views in the DOM.

-< Merged old projects in my workspace, so I have all that I need within my reach.
